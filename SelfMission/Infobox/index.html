                Poised beneath a twig-wigged tree,
                she spills her sparkling vocal powder:
                slippery sound slivers, silvery
                like spider's spittle, only louder.

                Oh yes, she Cares (with a high C)
                for Fellow Humans (you and me);
                for us she'll twitter nothing bitter;
                she'll knit her fitter, sweeter glitter;
                her vocal chords mince words for us
                and crumble croutons, with crisp crunch
                (lunch for her little lambs to munch)
                into a cream-filled demitasse.

                But hark! It's dark! Oh doom too soon!
                She's threatened by the black bassoon!
                It's hoarse and coarse, it's grim and gruff,
                it calls her dainty voice's bluff -
                Basso Profondo, end this terror,
                do-re-mi mene tekel et cetera!

                You want to silence her, abduct her
                to our chilly life behind the scenes?
                To our Siberian steppes of stopped-up sinuses,
                frogs in all throats, eternal hems and haws,
                where we, poor souls, gape soundlessly
                like fish? And this is what you wish?

                Oh nay! Oh nay! Though doom be nigh,
                she'll keep her chin and pitch up high!
                Her fate is hanging by a hair
                of voice so thin it sounds like air,
                but that's enough for her to take
                a breath and soar, without a break,

                chandelierward; and while she's there,
                her vox humana crystal-clears
                the whole world up. And we're all ears.

            <h2>Tab2 MIRACLE FAIR </h2>
            <p>
                The commonplace miracle:
                that so many common miracles take place.

                The usual miracles:
                invisible dogs barking
                in the dead of night.

                One of many miracles:
                a small and airy cloud
                is able to upstage the massive moon.

                Several miracles in one:
                an alder is reflected in the water
                and is reversed from left to right
                and grows from crown to root
                and never hits bottom
                though the water isn't deep.

                A run-of-the-mill miracle:
                winds mild to moderate
                turning gusty in storms.

                A miracle in the first place:
                cows will be cows.

                Next but not least:
                just this cherry orchard
                from just this cherry pit.

                A miracle minus top hat and tails:
                fluttering white doves.

                A miracle (what else can you call it):
                the sun rose today at three fourteen a.m.
                and will set tonight at one past eight.

                A miracle that's lost on us:
                the hand actually has fewer than six fingers
                but still it's go more than four.

                A miracle, just take a look around:
                the inescapable earth.

                An extra miracle, extra and ordinary:
                the unthinkable
                can be thought.

            <h2>Tab3 It's Most Fortunate</h2>
            <p>
                It's most fortunate
                that we do not know exactly
                what kind of world we live on.

                It would be necessary
                to have existed very long,
                decidedly longer
                than the world.

                If only for comparison
                to get acquainted with other worlds.

                One must soar out of the body
                which cannot do anything
                but limit
                and create difficulties.
                For the sake of research,
                clarity of the picture,
                and the final results,
                one must rise above time,
                in which everything drives and whirls.

                From this perspective
                you must once and for all get rid of
                details and episodes.

                Counting the days of the week
                must seem
                a meaningless activity,

                throwing letters into a mail box
                is a whim of foolish youth,

                the plaque "Don't trample the grass" is
                a senseless one.
